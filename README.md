aspito
======

Simple "Assets Pipeline" for PHP. Including SASS (CSS) and Uglify using node.js. Minifies the files and outputs gzip files that are the ones served in production environment.

Introduction
============

After been workin several months in Ruby on Rails projects, I missed some of their pipeline features in my small personal projects, specially SASS and Uglity. So this its my humble approach to have a JS / CSS pipeline in small PHP projects.

Abstract / How it works
=======================

To use ASPITO it's supossed that you develop in a **localhost environment** (local PHP server like XAMPP for instance), and you "deploy" to a **production server** (usually uploading your files by FTP).

The process its easy, each time you reload your webpage in development environment (localhost) **aspito** will:

- Reads all the CSS / JS files
- Puts them toguether in a single file
- Compiles SASS if needed
- Minifies all the files
- Writes a single gzip file with the result
- And returns a non-compressed file to the browser (much easier to debug in development)

**Once you upload your site to the server**

- Using a simple **.htaccess rule** server allways returns the gziped / minified file (you even don't need to upload the original JS / CSS files).
- In production environment (remote / public webserver) no files are compiled / minified. Aspito only performs the compression tasks in localhost.

Requirements
============

First of all you need to install node.js in your machine, and also the modules **node-sass** and **uglify** that are used to compile SASS and minify JS files.
<http://nodejs.org/>

Config
======

**Some important config data to get this working with your projects**

- Aspito asumes that if the domain name has a **.dev** extension you are in development, so to work in your localhost its necesary that you name your domain with **.dev** extension.

For instance, if your domain name in production server is:

    http://carloscabo.com

In your localhost must be named:

    http://carloscabo.dev

- Once you install node.js and node-sass / uglify you'll need to modify the **"_classes/sonata.aspito.class.php"** file to add the path to the node binaries in your machine.

- You can touch several things in the **sonata.aspito.class.php** file (as default filenames, for instance), but **if you do so remember to edit the .htaccess files you can fin in the root folder and also in /css and /js folders.**

Disclaimer
==========

This is a personal tool in a very beta stage, please use it carefully. Collaborations / sugestions are welcome, but remember this is a tool for small / personal projects.

Todo
====

- Add the options to compile files using a local node.js server instead of using comandline.

- Add some kind of JS / CSS tests in the sample files of the repository to be sure the SASS Compiling / JS Minifying is working fine.

Known issues
============

- Node-sass crashes compiling sass files if you have any CSS rule with old filter-opacity attribute (I still don't know why)

    filter: alpha(opacity=XX);
